# TEG-Blue™ Research Library
A clean entry point for researchers working on the Interactive Emotional Tools.

This repository starts with the **tools** that are being validated.  
Then it unfolds into the **frameworks** that power them.  
Finally it links the **research alignment and synthesis** behind the system.

## 1) Tools — from theory to measurable practice
- **Bridging Human EI and AI Safety**  
  *(upload later to)* `tools/Bridging_Human_EI__AI_Safety.pdf`  
  Explains why AI must learn emotional logic to recognize harm, empathy, and intent. Introduces TEG-Code and EMLU.

## 2) Frameworks — the theory behind the tools
- **Overview of the 11 Emotional Frameworks**  
  *(upload later to)* `frameworks/TEG-Blue__Overview_of_the_11_Emotional_Frameworks.pdf`

- **The Four Emotional Modes — Map of Human Behavior**  
  *(upload later to)* `frameworks/The_Four_Emotional_Modes_Of_TEG-Blue__A_Map_of_Human_Behavior.pdf`

## 3) Research Foundations — alignment and synthesis
- **Research Alignment — 30+ Models**  
  *(upload later to)* `alignment/2-Research_Alignment_30+_Models_TEG-Blue.pdf`

- **Detailed Synthesis — Emotional Technology for Healing and Repair**  
  *(upload later to)* `synthesis/3-Detailed_Synthesis_TEG-Blue.pdf`

- **How Frameworks Power TEG-Blue — Connecting Core Theories**  
  *(upload later to)* `synthesis/4-How_Frameworks_Power_TEG-Blue.pdf`

- **360° Synthesis — Integrating 30+ Frameworks** *(optional preface)*  
  *(upload later to)* `synthesis/1-TEG-Blue_360_Synthesis_Integrating_30+_Frameworks.pdf`
